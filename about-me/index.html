                <p>
                    My name is Martin Allsbrook. I’m a game designer and developer, recently graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder, with a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technology and Design. My degree and experiences have given me an interdisciplinary background, and a love for the synthesis of creative and technical disciplines. I’m currently looking for opportunities to apply my skills and grow in a professional environment, so if you’re looking for a team member like me please check out my <a href="../resume/MartinAllsbrook-Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and feel free to contact me.
