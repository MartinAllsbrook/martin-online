    <h2>Process:</h2>

    <h4>Basic Test Circut</h4>
    <p>To begin I built a simple circuit without a switch to make sure all my components were working properly. For safety reasons I began the circuit at ground and built it backwards towards the voltage source. I used a 220 ohm resistor and two red LEDs wired in series, all connected via the breadboard and jumper cables. The circuit is powered by the 5V voltage source on my ELEGOO UNO microcontroller. The circuit was working properly in this state so I proceeded to add a button in series with the resistor. </p>
