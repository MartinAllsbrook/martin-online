            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>The idea for this project came to me surprisingly quickly. Over the past few years I've developed an interesting habit of trying to do skateboard style flips with almost any object that ends up in my hands. Most often the object I’m flipping ends up being my phone. I find that the shape and weight of my phone work very well for many tricks, however constantly dropping my phone when I fail to land a trick isn’t the best for it. I’ve been trying to think of other objects that have a similar shape and weight to my phone but nothing has really come to mind other than a shaped metal block. </p>
            <p>When thinking of possible ideas for my final project this idea was the first thing to come to mind. Not only did I have an excuse to try to develop an object with the same feel as my phone, but I had the idea to turn the habit into some sort of game I and others could play. To create the feel of my phone I would have to make the object as flat as possible in one dimension, long in one, and somewhere in between for the final dimension. This profile also has some very important implications in terms of making the object feel like a skateboard, which I will explain later. In order to turn it into a game I wanted to implement a scoring system that rewards the player for landing multiple ticks without falling, like a “line” in classic skateboarding.</p>
