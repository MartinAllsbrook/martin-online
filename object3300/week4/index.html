    <h1>Week 4 - Serial</h1>

    <h2>DOCUMENTATION:</h2>
    <h3>STARTING OUT</h3>
    <p>I started my process by trying to think of cool ways I could use the joystick’s analog output separate from serial and p5.js, this LED me to the idea of the LEDs that show which way the LED is being pushed. I already thought this was pretty cool after trying it with two LEDs, so I added another two and mapped them all to the joystick outputs using the arduino and the arduino IDE.</p>
    <h3>FIRST STEPS WITH P5</h3>
    <p>By this point I had already gotten my arduino connected to p5 using serial in recitation and understood the process well so I began coding in p5. The first thing I wanted to do was create a cursor that held its position while the joystick was in its resting state, and could be moved by pushing the joystick in any direction. To do this I made a variable for X and Y position and added a fraction of the X and Y joystick inputs to them every tick. I use a fraction (1/50th) of the raw X and Y inputs because the faw input values are far two large and would always result in the cursor going off the canvas.</p>
    <h3>LASERS</h3>
    <p>This challenge was actually one of the most difficult in the entire coding process but by the time I got the cursor to stay within the bounds of the canvas I had gained a lot of confidence. My next step was to make the cursor shoot lasers. I did this by spawning another object slightly offset from the cursor's location and adding it to an array. I then move every object in the array up or down the canvas depending on if it’s a friendly or enemy laser. This step was not nearly as difficult but it taught me that JS is super helpful when working with arrays that change size.</p>
    <h3>ENEMIES</h3>
    <p>I then started to add enemies. I started by just adding another square to the canvas. I proceed by trying to make the square also shoot lasers on a random interval the opposite direction. To do this I simply added a boolean to the laser class that affects the direction it travels and made the enemy spawn lasers with the bool set to true. I then made an array of these enemies and set their positions.</p>
    <h3>MOVEMENT PATTERNS</h3>
    <p>Finally I made the enemies move in the pattern they currently move in. Working with a set of if-else statements and counters proved to be more difficult than I thought, as there were many pieces of the pattern I had to track. I ended up making two if-else trees; one to make the enemies move on their normal path, and one that gets activated every 5 repetitions and moves the enemies down an extra 20 units.</p>
    <h3>FINAL NOTES</h3>
    <p>At this point the game was done. I added a “GAME OVER” and “YOU WON” screens and had some fun playing it.</p>
