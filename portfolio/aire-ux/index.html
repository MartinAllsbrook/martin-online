                        I played a large role in The AIRE Dubai digital branding project during my time at Kilograph. The project consisted of creating a website, internal mobile application, renderings and visualization, and branding for the AIRE highrise development in Dubai.  My role primarily consisted of creating UX designs and prototypes in Figma, but I also gained experience communicating with members of a large interdisciplinary team.

                        My contributions to the project included designing the look of pages, making sure they fit within our style guidelines and could be displayed and navigated on any device or window size.

                    <p class="bottom-margin">
                        I also worked on user flows and information hierarchies. Particularly the organization of information and how the website may be used by different audiences to access the information.
