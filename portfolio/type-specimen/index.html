				<h4>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h4>
				<p>The goal of this project was simply to create a type specimen poster showing off a particular typeface, what makes it unique, and some of its history. I chose the typeface ITC Avant Garde Gothic as I had recently been studying avant garde architecture in another one of my classes and found its extremely geometric forms interesting and fun to play with. </p>
				<!-- <p>I found the skewed letters particularly interesting and fun to play with and wanted to highlight their unique nature. I achieved this by blowing up the letters and adding yellow accents along the two main axes that form the letters. This doubled as an example of how successful the typeface is when used for large display type and served as a backbone for the poster. </p>
				<p>Another highlight of this font is its numerous character variations and ligatures. I displayed this with an example of how the variations could be used to create a very futuristic and geometric lockup. I further emphasized these features by using equal spacing for all rectangular letters in the lockup, both vertically and horizontally, and by aligning them with the yellow accent. The typeface is not as successful in terms of readability so I decided it wasnâ€™t too necessary to give examples of it in paragraph form, but I did supply one.</p> -->
