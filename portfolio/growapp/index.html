                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p>A friend of mine had been struggling to properly care for some plants of his due to a variety of issues, particularly a lack of knowledge about what the plants needed at that time. This often ended up with him over caring for the plants out of fear that they were not receiving enough care. His brother, my roommate, then came up with the idea to create a cloud based moisture monitoring system that would alleviate the anxiety of not knowing. My roommate began developing prototypes for the sensor and I decided to join by doing some market research and designing a front end for the system.</p>
            
                <h3>Challenge:</h3>
                <p>GrowApp is an all-in-one garden management system that solves the issue of plant owners being unsure of the needs of their plants. The system uses a set of internet connected sensors to monitor various factors that affect the health of our users plants. We then generate a calendar of what the user needs to do in order to keep their plants healthy, in addition to sending out notifications if the plants need care urgently. The platform also has other resources such as forums where users can discuss various plant related issues, a large database of plant information to help advise the user, and journals for the user to log information about their plants.</p>

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>A variety of research methods were employed in order to gather information about our consumers and competitors, including user interviews, affinity mapping and a competitive analysis.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flexright">
                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>The GrowApp application will be a system that connects to a set of moisture sensors in order to collect information about the user's plants. The system will then generate a calendar and alerts to notify users about when they need to water or care for their plants, in addition to supplying users with other other plant-care related features The app will be able to help more proficient users such as gardeners, nurseries, or grow ops, as well as casual users with house plants.</p>
            
                <h3>Goals:</h3>
                <p>
                    When conducting user interviews I had a few goals in mind in terms of what I wanted to get out of the user interviews. These were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn what tools or systems people currently use to keep track of the watering cycle of their plants, if any.</li>
                        <li>Learn the types of plants people own and how they learned to take care of them.</li>
                        <li>Learn about people's experiences growing and caring for plants of all types.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Methodology:</h3>
                <p>I had few interviewees in mind already but I planned on finding most of my interviewees through friends of friends. I wanted to conduct my interviews mostly in person but if the circumstances didn't work out I was open to meeting via Zoom or the phone; however all the interviews ended up being conducted in person. The interviews were about 30 to 45 minutes each and I ended up conducting a total of 3.</p>

                <h2>INTERVIEWING</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="flexright">
                <h3>Example interview questions:</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tell me about your experience taking care of your plants.</li>
                        <li>How much value do your plants hold to you?</li>
                        <li>Do you use any tools to keep track of when to water your plants?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
    
                <h3>Participant screening:</h3>
                <p>
                    While looking for interviewees there were a few criteria I wanted to make sure my interviewees met. These were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Owner of multiple plants</li>
                        <li>Preferably a gardener or grower that owns plants of value</li>
                        <li>Preferably have had plants die on them in the past</li>
                        <li>Need participants that have been both good and bad at taking care of their plants</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Interview findings and insights:</h3>
                <p>The interviewing process was extremely helpful in finding out what I should be focusing on in terms of the final product. One of the biggest insights was that multiple interviewees complained about issues with soil or sunlight. Although it wouldn't be as regular as a watering schedule, I realized we could add a few more sensors to the moisture level probes and GrowApp could automatically assist users with advice about plants lacking sunlight or nutrients when issues came up.</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>I think it's a little hard to read my username and password on the sign in screen, maybe switch the colors used for the title and information?</li>
                    <li>I found the email confirmation screen a little confusing and didn't understand that I couldn't press 'Submit'.</li>

                    <li>The screen looked a little awkward with the colors swapped but I have darkened the information text color to make the screen more legible.</li>
                    <li>The submit button now has a slightly lowered saturation until the required information is entered.</li>

            </div>

            <div class="flexright">
                <h3>Conclusion and reflection:</h3>
                <p>This was my first fully fledged UX design project and I learned a lot from the process. One of the biggest takeaways I got was the importance of mid fidelity wireframes. After seeing some more examples of mid fidelity wireframes I've realized that mine is more of a digital low fidelity wireframe. At the time of creation I didn't quite realize how detailed a mid fidelity wireframe could get. Looking back I think my final high fidelity prototype would have benefitted from some more detail in the lower fidelity wireframes.</p>
                
                <h3>Future plans:</h3>
                <p>Going forward I would love to turn GrowApp into a fully fledged product along with my roommate and friends working on a prototype for the physical sensor. Most of the physical hardware is out of my area of interest so I think I would primarily stick to the front end work I'm currently doing. In terms of front end I would love to start developing a good logo or graphic to represent the app and idea as a whole. I would also like to start developing some of my figma prototypes in HTML so that we can actually host an application.</p>
