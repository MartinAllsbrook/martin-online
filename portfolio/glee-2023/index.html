                <p>This project was done as part of a logo design competition, sponsored by NASA's Artemis Student Challenges, from January 7th to January 28th, 2022. The goal was to create a new logo for the GLEE lunar mission that represented the project and included imagery of the earth, moon, and the “LunaSats” students are sending. The logos I designed ended up winning and will be used as the missions logo going forward.</p>
