            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="textBlockText">Panspermia is an infinitely large game world created using procedural generation in Unity. Our goal was to create a beautiful world that players could explore at their leisure, with the option for tension conflict if they so choose. The world is generated seamlessly using octaves of perlin noise and other techniques, creating a unique experience every time you play.</p>
            <p class="textBlockText">Our target audience is players who enjoy the exploration, tension, and beautiful procedural worlds in many survival games but have grown tired of the constant grind many of them put players through. We hope that Panspermia will provide a refreshing change of pace for those looking for a more open ended experience.</p>
