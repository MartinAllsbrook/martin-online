                <h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
                <!-- <p>This project is a mock poster mailer for the colorado symphony’s classics series meant to excite and inform recipients of the events that year. The poster would be sent folded in the shape of a postcard with only the graphics and general information showing.</p> -->
                <p>The inspiration for the design of the postermailer came from an amalgamation of the Mexico 68 Olympic graphics and Mondrian’s art. In addition I really wanted to use an abstraction of classical music to inspire some of the elements of the poster and thought that the repeating 5 line pattern common in sheet music would work very well. I used elements from the two styles mentioned in addition to elements of sheet music to create an almost mesmerizing pattern of repeating lines and shapes that propagate throughout the poster mailer. I wanted to keep the typography simple and geometric to align with the graphics surrounding it and chose two very simple sans serif typefaces.</p>
                <!-- <p>For my design I thought it would be really cool to abstract the look of lines of sheet music and create a design out of it. Originally I did this with the sets of 5 lines throughout the poster. This design started to feel somewhat like a mondrian to me, so I decided to add colorful “notes” to the design to invoke the mondrian feel as well and further push therefences to sheet music. When designing the graphic on the poster I wanted to stay consistent with the pattern of lines already present on the poster and was reminded of the logo of the Mexico 68 olympics. I took some inspiration from the logo and made a graphic that I think fits very well into the pattern present on the rest of my poster.</p> -->
