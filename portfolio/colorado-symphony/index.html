          <h4>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h4>
          <p>This poster mailer was a project for my text class. The objective of the assignment was to make a poster mailer with a clear theme and some abstract elements to advertise the Colorado Symphony’s 2021–2022 concert schedule.</p>

      <!-- <p>For my design I thought it would be really cool to abstract the look of lines of sheet music and create a design out of it. Originally I did this with the sets of 5 lines throughout the poster. This design started to feel somewhat like a mondrian to me, so I decided to add colorful “notes” to the design to invoke the mondrian feel as well and further push therefences to sheet music. When designing the graphic on the poster I wanted to stay consistent with the pattern of lines already present on the poster and was reminded of the logo of the Mexico 68 olympics. I took some inspiration from the logo and made a graphic that I think fits very well into the pattern present on the rest of my poster.</p> -->
